v2.0.2   1/21/04    Add more compilation targets.

    1. Added ``stdio.h'' include to ``query.cc'', in order to get at
       the ``vsnprintf()'' declaration in GCC 2.9x.

    2. Converted all instances of ``std::string::clear()'' to instead
       assign an empty string.  While they accomplish the same,
       apparently the API-complete ``std::string::clear()'' was not
       yet implemented in GCC 2.9x.

    3. Updated ``DESIGN'' document, advising on one more issue those
       converting from ORA++ will experience.

    4. Updated ``Makefile'', removing ``-O2''.  For some odd reason,
       *only* under RedHat's GCC 2.96 (shipped with RedHat 7.2) the
       library and resulting test program segfault quickly *only* when
       optimized.

       As GCC 2.96 has been deprecated even by RedHat themselves,
       those using other compiler toolchains (including GCC 3.x, and
       possibly 2.95.x) who think the optimizations may provide
       additional value should re-enable them by uncommenting the
       relevant portion of ``GEN_FLAGS'' at the top of the Makefile.

    5. Minor update to the test program to add a small set of extra
       things to "test".


v2.0.1   12/13/03   Initial release.
